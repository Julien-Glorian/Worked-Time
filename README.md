## Worked Time

### Code is actually evolving to v2, more information in specifications-sheet

Welcome !

This project has for goal to be able to count time. It will help for many usage 
in my case, because I really want to have a way to count without make attention 
when I'm taking a break.

Iteration 1 is finish and the project actually working, but iteration 2 will be
very interest because :
* I want to add a reader file to calculate the total time
worked (mentioned in specification-sheet)
* a new file with all the declaration of words (in anticipation to have multiple 
language, because I'm French)
* I want to make the program more readable during running
* a documentation of all methods in the program

The run of program is easily understandable, just write the instructions you want
to make.
